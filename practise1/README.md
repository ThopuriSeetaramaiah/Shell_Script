# Shebang-Everything

Your unofficial guidebook to shell programming

## Programs for practise

Write scripts for following programs yourself, if you are not able to solve them you can see the code.

### Program 1

Write a shell script that prints "Hello World!" to the screen.

[See the code here!](./prog1.sh)

### Program 2

Assign some message to a variable and display that variable to screen.

[See the code here!](./prog2.sh)

### Program 3

Store the value of `date` command in a variable and display the message "Today is: _______" where, `_____` represents output of `date` command.

[See the code here!](./prog3.sh)

### Program 4

Check whether /random exists.

[See the code here!](./prog4.sh)

### Program 5

Write a program to print your 5 favourite fruits.

[See the code here!](./prog5.sh)

### Program 6

Write a program to take address of file as arguement and then check the file type.
(Hint! use file command)

[See the code here!](./prog6.sh)

### Program 7

Write a shell script that prints "This script will return an exit status 200" and make sure that the script does return with an exit status 200.

[See the code here!](./prog7.sh)

### Program 8

Write a shell script that accepts the absolute path to a file or directory as an argument, and if that file/dir exists, it returns with 0 exit status. Else, it makes creates that directory and then return with code 1.

[See the code here!](./prog8.sh)

### Program 9

Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow".  If the command returns a 0 exit 
status report "Command Executed!" and exit with a 0 exit status.  If the command returns a 
nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command Not Executed!" and exit with a 1 exit status. 

[See the code here!](./prog9.sh)

### Program 10

Write a function in shell script to take a path as arguement and print the number of files/directories in that path.

**Hint** You can try copying the output of ls command in a text file and then count the number of lines in that file.

[See the code here!](./prog10.sh)
