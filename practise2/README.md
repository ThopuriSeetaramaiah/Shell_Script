Your unofficial guidebook to shell programming

## Programs for practise-2

Write scripts for following programs yourself, if you are not able to solve them you can see the code.

### Program 1

Write a shell script that prints "This script will return an exit status 200" and make sure that the script does return with an exit status 200.

[See the code here!](./prog1.sh)

### Program 2

Write a shell script that accepts the absolute path to a file or directory as an argument, and if that file/dir exists, it returns with 0 exit status. Else, it makes creates that directory and then return with code 1.

[See the code here!](./prog2.sh)

### Program 3

Write a script that executes the command "cat /etc/shadow".  If the command returns a 0 exit 
status report "Command Executed!" and exit with a 0 exit status.  If the command returns a 
nonÂ­zero exit status report "Command Not Executed!" and exit with a 1 exit status. 

[See the code here!](./prog3.sh)

### Program 4

Write a function in shell script to take a path as arguement and print the number of files/directories in that path.

**Hint** You can try copying the output of ls command in a text file and then count the number of lines in that file.
